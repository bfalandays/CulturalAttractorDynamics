# CulturalAttractorDynamics
Agent-based model from Falandays &amp; Smaldino (2022) "The Emergence of Cultural Attractors"

Includes the Python code for our agent-based model of cultural attraction as a Jupyter notebook ('model_main.ipynb'). Also contains the sample of realistic social networks used ('real_world_nets'), a script for extracting/processing data ('Process_data.py'), and R scripts used for plotting ('plotting_scripts'). All of the data that went into the paper is available on our OSF repository: https://osf.io/6bsyx/
